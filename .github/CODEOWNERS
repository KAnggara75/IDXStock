# The CODEOWNERS file is used by GitHub to automate assigning code reviews, see
# [1] and [2]. We also use it in our internal tooling (see [3]) to automate test
# failure issue routing. To do this efficiently, we are enforcing a few rules in
# this file via linting. They are:
#
# - every file under ./pkg has to have at least one owner, and each owner must
#   be present in TEAMS.yaml (either as a map key or an alias).
# - you can opt out of GitHub-requested code review assignments (while
#   maintaining team ownership) prefixing the line with `#!`.
#   (This will hide the line from GitHub, but our internal tooling continues to
#   parse it).
#   Note that it is customary also to use a team name with `-noreview` suffix in
#   the lines that start with `#!` (the suffix is trimmed in codeowners package).
# - there is a special team @cockroachdb/unowned (only to be used with #! prefix as
#   to not confuse Github) for the rare situations in which a file has no canonical owner.
#   Please use this sparingly.
#
#   TODO(test-eng): it would be good to lint that following a `#!` marker all mentioned
#   teams match @cockroachdb/{unowned,*-noreview}.
#
# Remember, *the last rule to match wins*, and you need a trailing slash to get
# recursive ownership of a directory.
#
# When you send a PR to update this file, please look at the "Files" tab and
# fix any errors Github reports.
